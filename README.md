# Dynamic CSS Class Prefixer

The Dynamic CSS Class Prefixer is a tool that allows users to automatically add prefixes to class names in HTML and CSS files. This project simplifies the process of preventing CSS class conflicts by dynamically modifying class names in both HTML and CSS files. Users can input their HTML and CSS files, and the tool will generate modified files with prefixed class names, ensuring seamless integration and compatibility with existing stylesheets and themes. This tool is particularly useful for developers working on projects with large codebases, enabling them to avoid manual renaming and potential conflicts while enhancing the maintainability and scalability of their web applications.

- Seamless Integration: Ensures compatibility and prevents class conflicts with existing stylesheets and themes.
- Efficient Processing: Streamlines the process, saving time and effort for developers working on large projects.
- Maintainability: Enhances code maintainability by providing a systematic approach to class naming conventions.

## Functionality

- HTML Class Prefixing: Parses the input HTML file and prefixes all class names, ensuring they do not conflict with existing styles.
