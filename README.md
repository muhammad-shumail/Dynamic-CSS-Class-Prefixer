# Dynamic CSS Class Prefixer

Introducing the Dynamic CSS Class Prefixer, a lifesaver for WordPress developers dealing with the challenges of integrating custom HTML and CSS sections into their projects. As many WordPress themes rely on the Bootstrap framework for styling, conflicts often arise when attempting to implement custom styles, leading to a mismatched and unappealing website layout.

In my own WordPress project, I encountered this issue firsthand. Despite extensive searches and consultations on platforms like Stack Overflow, finding a solution proved elusive. Online tools failed to address the problem adequately, leaving me frustrated and time-strapped.

However, a breakthrough came when I stumbled upon web scraping techniques. Delving deeper, I discovered Python's BeautifulSoup library, which became the key to my solution. Harnessing the power of web scraping, I created the Dynamic CSS Class Prefixer to automate the process of adding prefixes to class names in HTML and CSS files.

This tool simplifies the prevention of CSS class conflicts, offering a seamless integration experience. By inputting your HTML and CSS files, the Dynamic CSS Class Prefixer automatically generates modified files with prefixed class names. This not only ensures compatibility with existing stylesheets and themes but also eliminates the manual effort of renaming classes, enhancing the overall maintainability and scalability of your web applications.


## Features

- Dynamic Prefixing: Automatically adds prefixes to class names in both HTML and CSS files.
- Seamless Integration: Ensures compatibility and prevents class conflicts with existing stylesheets and themes.
- Efficient Processing: Streamlines the process, saving time and effort for developers working on large projects.
- Maintainability: Enhances code maintainability by providing a systematic approach to class naming conventions.

## Functionality

- HTML Class Prefixing: Parses the input HTML file and prefixes all class names, ensuring they do not conflict with existing styles.
- CSS Class Prefixing: Reads the input CSS file and adds prefixes to all class names, maintaining consistency with the modified HTML file.
- Output Files: Generates modified HTML and CSS files with the prefixed class names for users to download and integrate into their projects.
